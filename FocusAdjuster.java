	/**
	 * Moving the screen to follow the player position.
	 * We could do it in many ways, but two are:
	 * 1. Move the screen continuously such that the player
	 * is always in the center
	 * 2. Move the screen only when the player has gotten out
	 * of some boundary, and re-center him.
	 * We will be using the nÂ°2. 
	 * 
	 * As long as the player is not in firsQuartile || this.fourthQuartile,
	 * we do not move the screen.
	 * Once the player crosses the boundaries, we start the screen 
	 * update process.
	 * We will move the screen up or down if he is in the this.firstQuartile 
	 * or this.fourthQuartile respectively. We will move it as long as we 
	 * have not managed to put him in some middle region around the 
	 * median.
	 * Once we manage to put him there, we stop the screen moving
	 * process.
	 * 	-> This means that if the player keeps moving we will have
	 * to follow him all the way, resulting in option 1.
